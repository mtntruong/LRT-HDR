7 August 2015 HDR-VDP 2.2.2 (released 29 March 2020) 
    * This is just an updated release that improves compatibility with newer versions of Matlab. 
      It is based on the 2015 version of the metric and is relesed as they are delays with v3.0.
      The predictions of this version should be the same as 2.2.1.
    * Code fixed to run smoothly on Matlab 2019a
    * Added 'example' folder with a few example how to run the metric.

21 January 2014 HDR-VDP 2.2.1
   * Fixed issue when "Q" varied with image size. Q is now scaled 
     differently: 100 for the best quality and gets lower.
   * Q_MOS has been removed as unreliable. Use "Q instead. Note that the 
     relation between Q and MOS is not specified for now.
   * Some memory optimizations

19 October 2014 HDR-VDP 2.2.0

   * Improved quality predictions (pooling function optimized for HDR quality data set).
   * matlabPyrTools bundled with HDR-VDP-2 for easier installation
   * New improved hdrvdp_visualize.m
   * Surround luminance (surround_l) is set to very low luminance (1e-5) by default
   * Added check for very low physical values to avoid a common misuse for color encodings
   * Minor performance improvement (caching)

21 January 2013 HDR-VDP 2.1.3

   * Updated documentation
   * Better compatibility with earlier versions of matlab
   * Better handling of surround_l - if computed automatically, it is kept 
     the same for both reference and test images. This avoids false detection
     at the image boarder.

27 October 2011 HDR-VDP 2.1.2

   * Updated "epsilon" values that prevent NaN due to log of 0, but
     also cause Q_MOS to be relatively low for two identical images

30 August 2011 HDR-VDP 2.1.1

   * Fixed CSF formula in the code to be consistent with the
     paper. The CSF fitting parameters were updated as well.

17 June 2011  HDR-VDP 2.1

   * Extened model: CSF measured at 0.002 cd/m^2
   * New fit: fit to the new CSF measurements
   * New measurements: csfla dataset
   * New measurements: complexfest dataset
   * Bug fixed: nCSF did not change below 1 cd/m^2

28 April 2011  HDR-VDP 2.0

   This is the initial release, included with the supplementary
   materials of the SIGGRAPH'11 paper.
