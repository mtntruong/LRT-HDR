The folder contains two ZIP files
- Datasets.zip: This file contains 187 and 32 multi-exposure image sets generated from the HDM-HDR and HDRv datasets, respectively, as described in the paper.
- All_Synthesized_Results.zip: We also provide HDR images synthesized by the proposed algorithm and all other competing algorithms, so that you can inspect the results to your heart's content without rerunning 10 algorithms.
